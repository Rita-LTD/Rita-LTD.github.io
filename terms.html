    <h1>Terms and Conditions for Rita-LTD Apps</h1>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using our mobile applications (the "Apps"), you agree to be bound by these Terms
        and Conditions, our Privacy Policy, and all applicable laws and regulations governing the use of the Apps. If
        you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing the Apps.</p>

    <h2>2. Use License</h2>
    <p>Permission is granted to download and use the Apps solely for personal, non-commercial use. This is the grant of
        a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Modify or copy the Apps.</li>
        <li>Use the Apps for any commercial purpose or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial).</li>
        <li>Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained within the Apps.</li>
        <li>Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the Apps.</li>
        <li>Transfer the Apps to another person or "mirror" the Apps on any other server.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>The Apps are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We make no warranties, expressed or implied,
        and hereby disclaim and negate all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or
        conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property
        or other violation of rights. Further, we do not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy,
        likely results, or reliability of the use of the Apps or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites
        linked to the Apps.</p>

    <h2>4. Limitations</h2>
    <p>In no event shall Rita-LTD or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for
        loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the Apps,
        even if Rita-LTD or a Rita-LTD authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the
        possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or
        limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

    <h2>5. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Jurisdiction],
        without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p>Rita-LTD reserves the right to revise these Terms and Conditions at any time without notice. By using the Apps,
        you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these Terms and Conditions.</p>
